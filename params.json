{"name":"Genomicsel","tagline":"Genomics tools platform ","body":"### Welcome to the genomicsel project !\r\n\r\nThe `genomicsel` R package will consists of different functionalities that can be used for different methods of genomic predictions and genome-wide association mapping as part of single package along with available testing datasets.\r\n\r\n**What is machine learning**\r\n\r\nMachine learning is construction of algorithm or use of scientific learning from data. Such method include building model based on the inputs (known as training dataset) - not explicitly programmed instructions and use the models to make predictions or decision.\r\n\r\n**What is genomic or genome-wide prediction ?**\r\n\r\nGenomic prediction is application of machine learning tools that use the genomics data in making prediction or making decision.\r\n\r\n**What is genome-wide / genomics selection**\r\n\r\nPracticing plant or animal selection decisions based on genomics prediction.\r\n\r\n**What is genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis ?**\r\n\r\nUsing genome-wide markers, GWAS is approach of finding genetics responsible for qualitative and quantitative traits. Such genes can be used for making selection decisions. Such approach usually use broad genetic material rather using a single family .\r\n\r\n**What is linkage based QTL mapping ?**\r\n\r\nMapping of quantitative trait loci(QTL) based on linkage has same object that of GWAS, however this use a single or few families as population for genetic discovery.\r\n\r\n**Project objective:**\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to create R package platform that can perform different genomics analysis in single platform.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nUmesh R Rosyara \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe package is at early stage of development. Once support version is released bugs or suggestions should be suggested to rosyara_at_wisc.edu. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
